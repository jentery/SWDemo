The following materials include course outlines, assignments, prompts, teaching notes, lesson plans, and workshop instructions for literary sound studies. They are ordered alphabetically by title. 

Note that these materials appear as they were originally written for teaching and learning. We formatted them for the purposes of collection but did not edit them.
