Welcome to SpokenWeb Pedagogy, a [collection](https://jentery.github.io/SWDemo/mdfiles/) of materials for learning and teaching literary sound studies. 

The SSHRC-funded [SpokenWeb](https://spokenweb.ca/) partnership aims to develop coordinated and collaborative approaches to literary historical study, digital development, and critical and pedagogical engagement with diverse collections of literary sound recordings from across Canada and beyond.

## About 

All files in the collection are converted into [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using the [SWTools](https://github.com/callumyci/SWTools) script. 

[Documentation](https://github.com/callumyci/SWTools/blob/main/README.md) for the SWTools script describes how it automatically converts pedagogical materials (such as course outlines, lesson plans, and workshop instructions written in a word processor) into Markdown using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). 

The script also generates associated [YAML](https://yaml.org/) metadata files based on a [spreadsheet of metadata](https://github.com/jentery/SWDemo/blob/main/metadata.xlsx) (XLSX). YAML for each file includes metadata for the title, layout, filename, permalink, document type, discipline, affiliated project URL, and author's name(s), institution(s), and email address(es). 

The collection is designed to be published to a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll)-based web instance. It uses the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. 

Project developer: Callum Carroll-Ireton (UVic)    
Project editor: Jentery Sayers (UVic)    
SpokenWeb director and PI: Jason Camlot (Concordia)   

## Roadmap 

* Add more files to the collection.
