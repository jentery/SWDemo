ENGLISH 509 REMEDIATING THE ARCHIVE   
PODCAST ASSIGNMENT   
Due: Friday January 7   
Value: 20% of your final grade  

In groups of three, you will record a podcast during Block Week that
engages in some way with archival literary audio. Each podcast will be
15-20 minutes in length and should include the incorporation of archival
literary audio in some way. You will be given class time each day to
plan and record your podcast. Given the online environment of our
course, I would recommend you use Zoom to record your podcast, but you
may use any program you wish to create the podcast.

There are a number of podcast formats you could base your podcast on.
The podcast could take the form of a discussion of a particular audio
recording of a literary performance, following on the model of the
[PoemTalk podcast](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/podcasts.php) at PennSound.

You could also follow the format of the [SpokenWeb podcast](https://spokenweb.ca/podcast/episodes/) series:


Other possibilities could involve an interview with a poet in which you
discuss a recording of their work, or a discussion of a particular event
or reading series (such as the [reading series at Sir George Williams
University](https://montreal.spokenweb.ca/sgw-poetry-readings/) between 1965 and 1974.

You are encouraged to work with literary audio that fits within the
parameters of our course, i.e. contemporary Canadian / Indigenous /
BIPOC writers. You are strongly encouraged to discuss your plans with me
as they take shape to ensure you are following these expectations. On
Friday at the end of our course, all podcasts will be posted and we will
listen to them as a group.
