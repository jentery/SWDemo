*by Jason Camlot* 

*Shortform Podcast*: In addition to writing a final paper, you will be
required to engage in scripting and producing a short and simple podcast
of 4-6 MINUTES in length. The podcast may adapt to this sonic form of
digital publishing an idea from your final paper, or it may go in a
different direction, entirely. We will discuss the podcast at length in
class, including some of the basic tools (recorder and software) you
will need to produce this assignment. Your shortform podcast must be
completed and submitted to me using wetransfer (\<
<https://wetransfer.com/>\>) or on USB key by Friday, April 3rd. We
will hold a listening session and discussion of all podcasts during our
final class on Monday, April 6th.

Criteria for evaluating the podcast, and what it should, at the most
basic level, contain and try to do:

1.  It should imagine its **audience** and that should be audible in
    some way, whether explicitly or implicitly. This entails thinking
    about your tone, register, 'voice', and what it is contributing to
    your expository goals.
2.  It must have at least one audible sample (a **sound clip**) that is
    used either to illustrate an argument being made, or as an object of
    analysis for the discussion pursued.
3.  It must have a **script** (not necessarily a full transcript, but a
    detailed outline) that shows the arrangement of the materials and
    sounds, and, ideally, that suggests a rationale for how the
    materials, arguments, stories and sounds are presented. So, you will
    need to produce a written script to accompany the completed podcast
    that you hand in.
4.  It may include **other sounds** that are included for effect or
    support of the podcast, but that aren't central objects of analysis
    (sound effects, situating sounds, background music, etc.)
5.  It may include **interviews** with others (experts, peers,
    'subjects'). If you perform interviews, you will need to have them
    sign a permission form so that you can use the audio you have
    recorded in your podcast. This leads to the next point:
6.  **Ethics and rights** will be a consideration as you work on your
    podcast. *As much as possible*, you should try to know about and
    secure the rights to the sounds you will use in your podcast. You
    don't need to HAVE the rights to everything for the private
    assignment you're submitting (you're not publishing it when you send
    it to me), but rights issues are a big question for any podcast that
    is published, and you should take these matters into consideration.
    Similarly, you should consider the ethical implications of any
    sounds or speech you decide to include in a podcast. Do you have the
    ethical right to share something that may have bene understood as
    'private', or that may be disturbing to listeners? For the rights
    questions, you should identify (in your script) rights information
    that you have for the sounds you use. The ethical questions are more
    a matter of your own thinking on the use of sounds in a published
    podcast.
7.  You should aim for **good sound quality** and **high-quality
    production** in the podcast you create. This will entail figuring
    out how to normalize the volume of the clips you use so that they
    play at more or less the same amplitude, and how to record sounds
    without distracting or unwanted audio.
8.  The **final output** should be a single WAV file of between 4-6
    minutes in length.
