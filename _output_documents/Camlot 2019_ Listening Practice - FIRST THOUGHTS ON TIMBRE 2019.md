**timbre, n.3**

> Etymology: \< modern French timbre: see timbre n.1, timbre n.2 From
> the sense 'bell', 'small bell' (see timbre n.1) arose that of 'sound
> of a bell', 'sonorous quality of any instrument or of a voice', and
> finally that of 'character or quality of sound' (= German Klangfarbe),
> in which the word has passed into English use, retaining its French
> pronunciation.

The character or quality of a musical or vocal sound (distinct from its
pitch and intensity) depending upon the particular voice or instrument
producing it, and distinguishing it from sounds proceeding from other
sources; caused by the proportion in which the fundamental tone is
combined with the harmonics or overtones (= German Klangfarbe).

**OED Online**

(The auditory sensation where a listener judges that two sounds are
different using criteria other than pitch, loudness, duration.)

Timbre tends to be the psychoacoustician\'s multidimensional
waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or
loudness, including short-term spectral changes such as onset
transients, long-term spectra, those dynamic qualities which a musician
would term \"texture,\" and so on.

**Stephen McAdams and Albert Bregman, "Hearing Musical Streams,"
Computer Music Journal, Vol. 3,** **No. 4 (Dec., 1979), p. 30.**

The perception of timbre and the identification of an event can come
about only from the patterning of acoustic energy. The acoustic
patterning creates perceptual differences among events, and it is by
means of this patterning that identification is possible. In order for
identification to occur, the difference among several instances of one
instrument, one speaker, or one event must be less than the differences
between different instruments, speakers or events. This need not be true
for all attributes, but it must be true for one attribute or a
combination of attributes. Only if we can determine what acoustic
information reliably signals one event as opposed to another in each
context will it be possible to model how a listener can make a correct
identification.

**Stephen Handel, *Listening: An Introduction to the Perception of
Auditory Events*, p. 226.**

In brief, timbre refers both to the overall sound that enables us to
distinguish one instrument from another, and to the different sounds
within a single instrument. The composite sound is made up of different
partials, or frequencies. In classical vocal production a concentration
of partials around 3,000Hz---known as the singer's formant---is favored.
This creates the characteristic "ring" in the voice (the intense "core")
and enables it to cut through and be heard over the massive sound of a
symphony orchestra. Many vocal pedagogical texts feature in-depth
discussions of the physics and vocal training that go into its
production.

**Nina Sun Eidsheim, *The Race of Sound: Listening, Timbre & Vocality in
American Music*, p. 216n20**

Racialized conceptions of vocal timbre persist. But why has vocal timbre
resisted analysis when most aspects of the racialized body have been
critically treated? I contend that fundamental misconceptions about
voice and vocal timbre have prevented careful and critical analysis.
Therefore, if we think about this problem simply through questions
around race, and voice examining basic understandings of voice, we will
fail to get to the root of how categories, including race, are
constructed through vocal timbre. In other words, we will easily note
the attitudes about people that are overlaid on top of voice, but we
will not be able to identify the distinct building blocks with which
racialized timbre is projected, perceived, manifested, and sustained.

**Nina Sun Eidsheim, *The Race of Sound: Listening, Timbre & Vocality in
American Music*, p. 40**

How is gender signaled vocally?\...Parameters and characteristics that
have been identified as gendered markers include word choice, precise
articulation (clearly pronounced consonants and endings of words),
uptalk (ending declarative sentences with a rising intonation, or a
pitch contour associated with a question), more upward shifts in F0
\[fundamental frequency\], fewer downward shifts in F0, variable
intonation contours, and longer word durations...\[O\]ne \[interesting\]
differentiating factor is the use of what I call timbral scare
quotes---the use of a portion of the voice that is set apart timbrally
from what the singer deems to be the normative part of his or her voice.
\[I.E. falsetto in male singers.\] \[NOTE: F0, fundamental frequency,
associated with the lowest frequency in a harmonic series.\]

**Nina Sun Eidsheim, *The Race of Sound: Listening, Timbre & Vocality in
American Music*, p. 40**

The materiality of voice has to do with the sound itself as well as with
the bodily process of producing and attending to voices. When we
consider the musical voice as a sonic phenomenon, not merely as a
vehicle for words or music, timbre---commonly referred to as voice
quality or tone color, or colloquially referred to as an instrument's or
vocalist's "sound"---becomes central. Perhaps because words used to
describe timbre---such as "warm," "bright," "open," "husky," "gruff,"
"creaky,"---are seemingly subjective and highly culturally variable,
they are also an extremely socially meaningful aspect of vocal sound and
performance. The materiality of voice is also a feature of spoken
language. Linguistic variation, a classic topic within sociolinguistics,
is a sonic vocal phenomenon with powerful social meanings and effects,
as are intonational patters and other "prosodic" features of language
such as timbre, pitch, and volume. Particular vocal practices may
originate in a very specific kind of event but then become generalized
as vocal "gestures" that can be used to project a certain status for the
speaker, retaining some aspect of the original situation in their sonic
iconicity.

**Amanda Weidman, "Voice," in *Keywords in Sound* p. 235**

The realm of language is vast, and styles of speech are its internal
borders that divide this linguistic universe into multiple areas of
usage. The container for language is human speech and, miraculously, the
human brain makes it possible 'to store and hear' speech in the mind
even when nobody actually utters anything. Our memory holds samples of
speech, visual representations of situations, emotional impressions,
sounds and voices. When we read a page, our memory allows these samples
to echo each other variously, together with the new incoming voices of
the text adding prominence to some elements and obscuring the others.
And when we finish reading, miraculously again, we keep in our memory
the ebbs and flows of intonations, rhythms and timbres as a general
sensation of the living human speech that can be brought to life only
and exclusively by the voices of the people who lived in the past and
still live among us.

Literature*, pp. 9-10.**
